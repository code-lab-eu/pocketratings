# Line width in README and documentation

When editing **README.md** or files under **docs/** (e.g. `docs/spec.md`, `docs/api.md`):

- **Wrap prose and list text to 80 characters** per line. Break long sentences or
  list items onto the next line rather than exceeding 80 characters.
- **Code blocks**: Long commands or URLs may be split with line continuation (e.g.
  backslash in shell) where it does not change behavior; otherwise leave a long
  line inside a code block if breaking would harm copy-paste.
- This keeps the docs readable in narrow terminals and keeps diffs minimal when
  editing.
