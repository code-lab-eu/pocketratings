# Example override for running behind a bastion host (reverse SSH tunnel).
# Use when you do not want to bind Caddy to host port 80 (e.g. to avoid
# conflicts with other web projects). Copy to compose.override.yml on the
# server and run: podman-compose up -d
#
# Tunnel on the home server: -R 3080:localhost:3080
